#  ECE564_HOMEWORK
This is your README file - you need to add any info for each homework that you want to make sure we grade for extra function points.  
### HW1 -
#### 1. The required functionalities are all completed:
    (1) Pass it one string that starts with “/n” (for “name”) and is followed by either 1 or 2 words. 
        If there are 2 words after the “/n”, assume they are “firstName” followed by “lastName”.  
        If there is only 1 word after the “/n”, assume it is either “firstName” or “lastName”. 
        For example, find(“/n Ric Telford”) or find(“/n Telford”) or find(“/n Ric”). 
        Once a match is found, return the full description of the person formatted as shown in the playground file.
    (2) Handle all error cases.


#### 2. Functionalities for bonus points:
    The guide for how to test those funtionalities are in the HW1.playground.
    (1) Compact code, well-structured.
    (2) Interesting and/or broad use of Swift capabilities: eg. use filter function to search and find person.
    (3) Support for other search parameters in the string: /w for “whereFrom” and /d for “degree.
    (4) Support for multiple search parameters in the same string, such as “/n Telford /w NC”.
    (5) Returning all matches to the search parameters, not just the first one found.
    (6) The order of the search parameters can be arbitrary: eg. the results of “/n Telford /w NC” and “/w NC /n Telford” are the same.
    (7) Handle all error cases of bad input format.
